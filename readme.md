	* The program asks the user for a number n and prints the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 that are between 1 and n.


This like the previous one, was a very simple program with three functions: one that takes a value from the user and send it to be computed, a function one that computes it and sends the result to be displayed, and a third function in charge of displaying it to the user.

This time, though, I chose to have one single object instead of three objects (MVC I think it's called the three object model?).

I coded the whole thing in a go and checked the code several times before running the program. I was almost sure it was going to work without any debugging being necessary, and that would be a primer. However it didn't work, I got a reference error saying myObj wasn't defined.

After some testing I found out I had separated the functions inside the object with semicolons instead of commas. Once that was fixed, it worked perfectly.

I didn't spend much time on the CSS side of this project. I want to jump to the next one. Maybe in a couple of months I will focus solely on CSS skills and will polish the look of my projects one by one.

Conclusions: after noticing in the last exercise how much I had forgotten during the inactivity period, I am happy that I managed to code this one fairly quickly. I know it is a very simple program, but still! I am excited and looking forward for the next exercise.
